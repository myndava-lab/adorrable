Update our Next.js (App Router) landing page UI for Adorrable.dev using Tailwind CSS.

Goals

Remove the gear/settings icon from the question box entirely.

Keep Select Industry and Select Region visible at all times as standard dropdowns.

Add two language toggle groups (button-style toggles):

One toggle group sits directly under Select Industry.

Another toggle group sits directly under Select Region.
Each toggle group should include: English, French, Swahili, Pidgin. Only one can be active at a time per group.

Maintain the current hero and gradient branding, but use Adorrable colors:

Primary: #22C55E (green-500), Accent: #A78BFA (violet-400), Surface: #0B1220 (near black), Card: #111827 (gray-900).

Inputs should be rounded-xl, dark UI, soft inner shadows, and clear focus rings.

Mobile-first responsive: stack elements on small screens; show two columns for the controls on ≥ md.

Accessible: proper labels, aria-pressed on toggle buttons, keyboard focus states.

Implementation details
• Files to touch: app/page.tsx, app/globals.css (if needed), and a small reusable components/ToggleGroup.tsx.
• Replace the settings icon area with a controls section:

Row 1: the text input (“Ask Adorrable…”) with submit button (arrow).

Row 2 (visible always):

Col A: Select Industry (select) + Language toggle group A (buttons).

Col B: Select Region (select) + Language toggle group B (buttons).
• Toggles are pill buttons with Tailwind classes like:
inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm border border-gray-700/60 hover:border-gray-500 transition aria-[pressed=true]:bg-green-600 aria-[pressed=true]:text-white
• Use React state to manage selected industry, region, and each group’s language.
• No external UI libs; only Tailwind.

Acceptance criteria

No gear icon anywhere.

“Select Industry” + its language toggles are always visible.

“Select Region” + its language toggles are always visible.

Works on mobile and desktop, visually matches Adorrable brand, and passes keyboard navigation (Tab/Enter/Space) for toggles.

The existing “Generate” flow still works (button disabled until industry & region chosen).

After implementing, show me the updated page.tsx JSX for the controls section and the ToggleGroup component.
