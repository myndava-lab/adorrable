Possible Causes:

Duplicate Import Statements:

Multiple import lines for the same module (e.g., next/server) in route.ts might exist due to copy-paste errors or refactoring leftovers.
Example: import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'; appearing more than once.


Multiple NextResponse Imports:

Importing NextResponse from different sources (e.g., next/server and another library) can cause a name collision, as TypeScript or the Next.js bundler may not resolve them consistently.


Multiple POST Function Definitions:

Defining more than one export async function POST(request: Request) in the same route.ts file violates Next.js Route Handler rules, which allow only one handler per HTTP method per file.



Fix and Enhancement:

Consolidate Imports:

Open app/api/images/upload/route.ts and remove duplicate import statements. Ensure only one import per module is present.
Example correction:
typescript// Before (incorrect)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'; // Duplicate

// After (correct)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';



Resolve NextResponse Collision:

Ensure NextResponse is imported only from next/server. Remove any imports from other sources (e.g., custom modules or outdated libraries).
Search the file for other NextResponse imports and standardize them.


Single POST Handler:

Check for multiple POST function definitions. Next.js Route Handlers allow only one POST export per file. Combine logic into a single handler.
Example correction:
typescript// Before (incorrect)
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Logic 1
  return NextResponse.json({ message: "First POST" });
}
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Logic 2
  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Second POST" }); // Error: Duplicate
}

// After (correct)
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Combine logic here
  const data = await request.json();
  // Logic 1 and 2
  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Combined POST" });
}



Rebuild and Deploy:

After fixing, save the file, and redeploy on Replit by running the deployment command (e.g., via the Replit UI or replit deploy).
Clear any build cache on Replit (delete the .replit cache or restart the instance if needed).


Debugging:

If errors persist, check the Replit console logs for the exact line numbers of duplicates and share them for further analysis.
Ensure no conflicting TypeScript types or middleware imports are interfering.
